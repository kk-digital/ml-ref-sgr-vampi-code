Write a Python class called `WeatherAPIClient` that fetches weather data from a REST API. The class should:

1. Accept an API base URL and optional API key in the constructor
2. Have an async method `get_current_weather(city: str)` that returns weather data
3. Have an async method `get_forecast(city: str, days: int)` that returns a forecast
4. Include proper error handling for network errors and invalid responses
5. Use type hints throughout
6. Include retry logic with exponential backoff (max 3 retries)

Use the `httpx` library for async HTTP requests.
