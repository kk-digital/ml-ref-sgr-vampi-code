Create a Python data validation module using Pydantic. Define the following models:

1. `Address` with fields: street, city, state, zip_code, country
2. `Person` with fields: first_name, last_name, email, phone (optional), date_of_birth, address
3. `Order` with fields: order_id, customer (Person), items (list), total_amount, created_at

Requirements:
- Email must be validated as a proper email format
- Phone number should be validated if provided
- date_of_birth should ensure the person is at least 18 years old
- total_amount must be positive
- Include a custom validator that ensures order_id follows pattern "ORD-XXXXX"

Include example usage showing validation success and failure cases.
