Create a complete Snake game in Python using the pygame library. The game should include:

1. A snake that moves in four directions (up, down, left, right) controlled by arrow keys
2. Food that appears randomly on the screen
3. Score tracking that increases when the snake eats food
4. Game over when the snake hits the wall or itself
5. A simple start screen and game over screen with the final score
6. The snake should grow longer each time it eats food

Make sure the code is well-organized with proper functions and includes all necessary imports.
