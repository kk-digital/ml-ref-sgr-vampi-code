https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8afd8caa-f084-4606-8ae0-b95f367a3c92


## SGR Vampi Code is an intelligent coding assistant powered by Schema-Guided Reasoning (SGR). It can run with small LLMs for fully local development assistance.

This project is developed by the **neuraldeep** community. It is inspired by the Schema-Guided Reasoning (SGR) work and [SGR Agent Demo](https://abdullin.com/schema-guided-reasoning/demo) delivered by "LLM Under the Hood" community and AI R&D Hub of [TIMETOACT GROUP Österreich](https://www.timetoact-group.at)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

First, install UV (modern Python package manager):

```bash
# Install UV
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
# or on Windows:
# powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

### Installation & Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/vamplabAI/sgr-vampi-code.git
cd sgr-vampi-code

# 2. Setup configuration
cp config.yaml.example config.yaml
# Edit config.yaml with your API settings

# 3. Install dependencies
uv sync

# 4. Run the interactive chat
uv run cli_stream.py chat
```

## 🎮 Usage

### Interactive Chat Mode

Start a continuous conversation with the coding assistant:

```bash
uv run cli_stream.py chat

# With custom typing speed
uv run cli_stream.py chat --speed 0.005  # Slower
uv run cli_stream.py chat --speed 0      # Instant

# With debug logging
uv run cli_stream.py chat --debug

# Work on a specific project directory
uv run cli_stream.py chat --workspace /path/to/project
uv run cli_stream.py chat -w ../other-project
```

### Single Task Mode

Execute a single coding task:

```bash
uv run cli_stream.py task "Analyze the project structure and list all Python files"

# Work on a different directory
uv run cli_stream.py task "Find all TODO comments" --workspace ~/my-project
```

### Fast Mode (No Typing Effect)

Get instant responses without the typing animation:

```bash
uv run cli_stream.py fast "Create a new utility function for file parsing"

# With custom workspace
uv run cli_stream.py fast "Refactor main.py" -w /path/to/project
```

### Workspace Parameter

The `--workspace` (or `-w`) parameter allows you to specify which directory the agent should work in. This is useful when:
- Running the agent from a different location than your project
- Working on multiple projects without changing directories
- Accessing projects in parent or sibling directories

```bash
# Relative path (from current directory)
uv run cli_stream.py chat --workspace ../sgr-deep-research

# Absolute path
uv run cli_stream.py chat --workspace /home/user/projects/my-app

# Current directory (default)
uv run cli_stream.py chat --workspace .
```

All file operations (read, write, edit, grep, list, find) will be relative to the specified workspace directory.

## 🛠️ Available Tools

The SGR Vampi Code agent has access to powerful tools for code manipulation:

### File Operations
- **ReadFileTool** - Read and analyze existing code files
- **WriteFileTool** - Create new files or overwrite existing ones
- **EditFileTool** - Make surgical edits to existing files (preferred for modifications)

### Code Search & Discovery
- **GrepTool** - Search for patterns across the codebase
- **ListDirectoryTool** - Explore project structure and organization
- **FindFilesTool** - Locate files by name patterns

### Execution
- **RunCommandTool** - Execute shell commands (build, test, lint, etc.)

### Reasoning & Planning
- **ReasoningTool** - Think through problems step-by-step
- **ClarificationTool** - Ask clarifying questions when needed
- **FinalAnswerTool** - Provide comprehensive answers in beautiful Markdown format

## 💡 Example Tasks

The coding assistant excels at various development scenarios:

### Code Analysis
```
"Analyze the current project structure and explain the architecture"
"Find all TODO comments in Python files"
"Show me how the authentication system works"
```

### Code Creation
```
"Create a new utility module for data validation with Pydantic"
"Add a new API endpoint for user registration"
"Implement a caching decorator for expensive functions"
```

### Code Modification
```
"Refactor the database connection code to use connection pooling"
"Add error handling to all API endpoints"
"Update the logging configuration to use structured logging"
```

### Debugging & Fixes
```
"Fix the import errors in the main module"
"Find and fix potential SQL injection vulnerabilities"
"Optimize the slow database queries in the user service"
```

## 🎨 Beautiful Markdown Responses

All final answers are automatically formatted in Markdown with:

- **Headers** for clear structure
- **Bold** and *italic* for emphasis
- `Code blocks` with syntax highlighting
- Lists for enumeration
- Tables for structured data
- Quotes for important notes
- Links for references

Example output:

```markdown
## Analysis Complete

I've analyzed the project structure. Here's what I found:

### Project Architecture

The project follows a **modular architecture** with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Core Module** (`sgr_deep_research/core/`)
   - `agents/` - Agent implementations
   - `tools/` - Tool definitions
   - `models.py` - Data models

2. **API Layer** (`sgr_deep_research/api/`)
   - FastAPI endpoints
   - Request/response models

### Key Findings

- ✅ Well-organized code structure
- ✅ Type hints throughout
- ⚠️ Some files missing docstrings
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Setup Configuration File

1. **Create config.yaml from template:**

```bash
cp config.yaml.example config.yaml
```

2. **Configure API settings:**

```yaml
# OpenAI API Configuration
openai:
  api_key: "your-api-key-here"        # Your API key
  base_url: "https://api.openai.com/v1"  # Or your local LLM endpoint
  model: "gpt-4o-mini"                # Model to use
  max_tokens: 8000                    # Maximum tokens
  temperature: 0.4                    # Generation temperature (0.0-1.0)
  proxy: ""                           # Optional proxy

# Execution Settings
execution:
  max_steps: 6                        # Maximum reasoning steps
  logs_dir: "logs"                    # Log directory
```

### CLI Commands

Inside the interactive chat, you can use these commands:

- `/exit`, `/quit`, `/q` - Exit the chat
- `/clear`, `/cls` - Clear the screen
- `/help`, `/h` - Show help information

## 🧠 Schema-Guided Reasoning for Coding

### Why SGR for Coding Tasks?

Traditional ReAct agents struggle with complex coding tasks on smaller models because they need to decide:
1. **What** to do next
2. **When** to use tools
3. **How** to structure the solution

SGR solves this by forcing structured reasoning first, then executing deterministically:

```python
# Phase 1: Structured Reasoning (always happens)
reasoning = model.generate(format="json_schema")
# {
#   "reasoning_steps": ["Read the file", "Identify the issue", "Plan the fix"],
#   "current_situation": "Found import error in main.py",
#   "remaining_steps": ["Fix the import", "Verify the change"]
# }

# Phase 2: Tool Selection & Execution (deterministic)
tool = select_tool_from_reasoning(reasoning)
result = execute_tool(tool)
```

### Coding Workflow

The agent follows a structured workflow:

1. **Understand** - Analyze the task and current codebase state
2. **Plan** - Break down complex changes into steps
3. **Execute** - Make changes incrementally with verification
4. **Verify** - Check that changes work as expected
5. **Report** - Provide clear summary in Markdown format

## 🎯 Best Practices

### When Using the Coding Assistant

1. **Be Specific** - Clear requests get better results
   - ✅ "Add error handling to the login function in auth.py"
   - ❌ "Fix the code"

2. **Provide Context** - Help the agent understand your needs
   - ✅ "Refactor the database code to use async/await for better performance"
   - ❌ "Make it faster"

3. **Iterative Approach** - Break large tasks into steps
   - ✅ "First, analyze the authentication flow. Then suggest improvements."
   - ❌ "Rewrite the entire authentication system"

4. **Verify Changes** - Always review what the agent modified
   - The agent will show you exactly what changed
   - Use git diff to see the full picture
